# Override nodes

There are multiple override node available. The behaviour of each node is still the same. It overrides the properties that are set in a [genric-lamp](generic-lamp.md) node. If a device does not support the properties that the override node will set, it will have no effect.

## Available nodes

- [override-brightness](override-brightness.md)
- [override-temperature](override-temperature.md)
- [override-color](override-color.md)
- [override-action](override-action.md)
