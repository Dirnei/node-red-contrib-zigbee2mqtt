# Exemplary Zigbee2MQTT and Node-RED setup

In this section, we will demonstrate a exemplary setup for [Zigbee2MQTT](https://www.zigbee2mqtt.io/), [Node-RED](https://nodered.org/docs/getting-started/) and [Mosquitto](https://mosquitto.org/man/mosquitto-8.html) using Docker. For more detailed documentation on how to set up these components, we recommend the linked documentation.

> **Note**: If you already have a working Zigbee2MQTT, MQTT-Broker, and Node-RED installation, you can skip this section.


## Prerequisites
You have a Linux machine with Docker installed.
We tested this on:
- An Intel NUC running Ubuntu Server 20.04 LTS
- A Raspberry PI 2 and 4 running Raspian / Raspberry Pi OS.

And you have a supported Zigbee adapter for Zigbee2MQTT.
See [Zigbee2MQTT Docs: What do I need?](https://www.zigbee2mqtt.io/getting_started/what_do_i_need.html). If you have a bit of money to spend, we suggest the [Texas Instruments LAUNCHXL-CC1352P-2 Zigbee adapter](https://www.zigbee2mqtt.io/information/supported_adapters.html#texas-instruments-launchxl-cc1352p-2) because the range is better and supports way more devices.

## Setup Process

1. **Verify that Docker and Docker Compose are installed.**
    ``` console
    andreas@nuc:~$ docker --version
    Docker version 19.03.13, build 4484c46d9d

    andreas@nuc:~$ docker-compose --version
    docker-compose version 1.27.4, build 40524192
    ```

2. **Plugin the Zigbee Adapter into your device.**
    
    It should appear as a device in `/dev`. Most of the time, the location is `/dev/ttyACM0`. See [Zigbee2MQTT docs](https://www.zigbee2mqtt.io/getting_started/running_zigbee2mqtt.html#1-determine-location-of-cc2531-usb-sniffer-and-checking-user-permissions).

    You can find the adapter in `/dev`
    ``` console
    andreas@nuc:~$ ls -d /dev/*ACM*
    /dev/ttyACM0
    ```
    
    If it is any different from `/dev/ttyACM0`, you have to update the device in the `docker-compose.yml` file to grant Zigbee2MQTT access to the adapter. We will create the `docker-compose.yml` in the **next step** - remember it for now.
    ``` yml
    services:
      zigbee2mqtt:
        devices:
          - device=/dev/ttyACM0
    ```

3. **Configuring the Docker containers**

    In this step, we will create three Docker containers using Docker compose.
    For simplicity, we will map the volumes to a folder in the users home directory.

    We will create three containers.
    - Mosquitto MQTT Broker
    - Zigbee2MQTT (Connects to Mosquitto)
    - Node-RED (Connects to Mosquitto)

    For general understanding: Node-RED does not directly connect to Zigbee2MQTT. Only via the Mosquitto broker as a middleware.

    Let's create some directories first.
    ``` console
    andreas@nuc:~$ mkdir ~/smarthome
    andreas@nuc:~$ cd ~/smarthome/
    andreas@nuc:~/smarthome$ mkdir nodered
    andreas@nuc:~/smarthome$ mkdir mosquitto
    andreas@nuc:~/smarthome$ mkdir mosquitto/config
    ```

    Now create the docker-compose file with the editor of your choice.
    ``` console
    andreas@nuc:~/smarthome$ nano docker-compose.yml
    ```

    The compose file contains our three containers (Node-RED, Zigbee2MQTT, and Mosquitto).
    You can copy and paste this configuration. Remember to adjust the Zigbee adapter if you are using a different adapter than `/dev/ttyACM0`.

    ``` yml
    version: "3.8"

    services:
      zigbee2mqtt:
        image: koenkk/zigbee2mqtt:latest
        container_name: z2m_composed
        volumes:
          - /run/udev:/run/udev:ro
          - ${PWD}/z2m:/app/data
        ports:
            - "8080:8080"
        environment:
          - TZ=Europe/Berlin
        devices:
          - device=/dev/ttyACM0
        network_mode: "host"
        restart: always
        privileged: true
        depends_on:
          - mosquitto

      mosquitto:
          image: eclipse-mosquitto
          container_name: mosquitto_composed
          volumes:
            - ${PWD}/mosquitto:/mosquitto
          ports:
            - "1883:1883"
            - "9001:9001"
          restart: always

      nodered:
          image: nodered/node-red
          container_name: nodered_composed
          volumes:
            - ${PWD}/nodered:/data
          ports:
            - "1880:1880"
          restart: always
          depends_on:
            - zigbee2mqtt
            - mosquitto
    ```

    Before we run our containers, we also have to configure Mosquitto.
    Create the following config using your favorite editor:

    ``` console
    andreas@nuc:~/smarthome$ nano mosquitto/config/mosquitto.conf
    ```

    Paste this configuration to define the logging and persistence locations.

    ```
    persistence true
    persistence_location /mosquitto/data/
    log_dest file /mosquitto/log/mosquitto.log
    ```

4. **Create and run the Docker containers**

    Now we can run our containers for the first time. Docker will pull all the images, and the containers will create their default configurations and initialize.

    ``` console
    andreas@nuc:~/smarthome$ docker-compose up
    ```

    Have a look at the output. If you can't see any errors, you should be good to go.
    After the containers are initialized, press <kbd>ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>c</kbd> to stop the containers.

5. **Configure PAN ID and Zigbee channel**

    After your containers have been stopped, open the Zigbee2MQTT configuration.

    ``` console
    andreas@nuc:~/smarthome$ sudo nano z2m/configuration.yaml
    ```

    It should look like this:

    ``` yml
    # Home Assistant integration (MQTT discovery)
    homeassistant: false

    # allow new devices to join
    permit_join: true

    # MQTT settings
    mqtt:
      # MQTT base topic for zigbee2mqtt MQTT messages
      base_topic: zigbee2mqtt
      # MQTT server URL
      server: 'mqtt://localhost'
      # MQTT server authentication, uncomment if required:
      # user: my_user
      # password: my_password

    # Serial settings
    serial:
      # Location of CC2531 USB sniffer
      port: /dev/ttyACM0
    ```

    At the end of the configuration, we add the advanced section. It defines a custom PAN ID and a channel. This is a best practice because, if a neighbor suddenly uses the same default PAN ID, re-pairing all the devices would be necessary.
    For more settings, check out the [Zigbee2MQTT configuration docs](https://www.zigbee2mqtt.io/information/configuration.html).
    Also enable the [frontend](https://www.zigbee2mqtt.io/information/frontend.html) and the experimental API, so we can see rename our devices.

    ``` yml
    advanced:
      # Optional: ZigBee pan ID
      pan_id: 815
      # Optional: ZigBee channel, changing requires re-pairing of all devices.
      # (Note: use a ZLL channel: 11, 15, 20, or 25 to avoid Problems)
      # (default: 11)
      channel: 15
    frontend:
      port: 8080
    experimental:
      new_api: true
    ```

6. **Run your containers in the background**

    You now configured all the basic settings. You are now ready to run the containers in the background. To do so, supply the `--detach` switch to the docker-compose command. See [Docker docs](https://docs.docker.com/compose/reference/up/).

    ``` console
    andreas@nuc:~/smarthome$ docker-compose up --detach
    ```

    If you want to stop the detached containers later to change the settings, you can run `docker-compose down`.


7. **Check everything is running** 

    Open `http://ip-of-your-device:8080/` in your browser, to view the Zigbee2MQTT frontend.

    Open `http://ip-of-your-device:1880/` in your browser.
    If an empty Node-RED dashboard loads, I'd like to congratulate you - you finished the Node-RED setup.

8. **Install the Zigbee2MQTT Nodes for Node-RED**

    1. The the Palettte: `Menu` > `Manage palette` > `Install tab`

    2. Search for `node-red-contrib-zigbee2mqtt-devices` and install it.

## After setup considerations

This setup is very basic. We suggest a few things that should be done but would be too much for this tutorial's scope. Have a look at the [Zigbee2MQTT](https://www.zigbee2mqtt.io/), [Node-RED](https://nodered.org/docs/getting-started/) and [Mosquitto](https://mosquitto.org/man/mosquitto-8.html) documentation on how to configure them.


**Authentication**

Right now, Mosquitto and the Node-RED interface do not use any authentication. We advise you to set up authentication.

**Secure connection**
With the default configuration, the MQTT connection and the HTTP connection to the Node-RED web interface are not encrypted. Mosquitto can be configured with TLS and Node-RED with HTTPS.

**Disable paring mode**
Currently, Zigbee2MQTT is configured to [let new devices join](https://www.zigbee2mqtt.io/getting_started/pairing_devices.html).
After you have added all your devices and are done with the initial setup, you should disable this by setting `permit_join: false` in the `z2m/configuration.yaml`.


# Pairing our devices with Z2M
Now it's time to [pair](https://www.zigbee2mqtt.io/getting_started/pairing_devices.html) our devices.

For my demonstration I use:
- [IKEA Tr√•dfri ON/OFF switch (E1743)](https://www.zigbee2mqtt.io/devices/E1743.html)
